# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js and MDX

Creating a blog with Next.js and MDX gives you the power of React components within your markdown content, making it perfect for technical blogs and documentation sites.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. This means you can:

- Use React components in your markdown
- Import and use custom components
- Add interactive elements to your content
- Maintain the simplicity of markdown for writing

## Setting up the Project

First, let's start with a Next.js project and add the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind --eslint
cd my-blog
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react gray-matter
```

### Project Structure

Here's how we'll organize our blog:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [slug]/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mdx-components.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ post-1.mdx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ post-2.mdx
â””â”€â”€ lib/
    â””â”€â”€ blog.ts
```

## Features We'll Implement

### 1. Dynamic Routing

Our blog will use Next.js dynamic routing to generate pages for each blog post automatically.

### 2. Syntax Highlighting

We'll add beautiful syntax highlighting for code blocks using rehype-pretty-code.

### 3. Reading Time Calculation

Automatically calculate and display estimated reading time for each post.

### 4. SEO Optimization

Generate proper metadata for each blog post to improve search engine visibility.

## Code Example

Here's how you can create a custom component for your MDX files:

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

interface CalloutProps {
  type?: "info" | "warning" | "error"
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function Callout({ type = "info", children }: CalloutProps) {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn("my-6 rounded-lg border p-4", {
        "border-blue-200 bg-blue-50 text-blue-900": type === "info",
        "border-yellow-200 bg-yellow-50 text-yellow-900": type === "warning",
        "border-red-200 bg-red-50 text-red-900": type === "error",
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

> **Important**: Always validate your frontmatter data and handle edge cases gracefully.

1. **Performance**: Use Next.js static generation for better performance
2. **SEO**: Include proper meta tags and structured data
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure your blog is accessible to all users
4. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for better developer experience

## Table Example

| Feature             | Status         | Priority |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| MDX Support         | âœ… Complete    | High     |
| Syntax Highlighting | âœ… Complete    | High     |
| Reading Time        | âœ… Complete    | Medium   |
| Search              | ðŸš§ In Progress | Low      |

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX provides a powerful foundation for content creation. The combination of markdown simplicity with React component flexibility makes it an excellent choice for technical blogs.

Try implementing these features step by step, and you'll have a fully functional blog system that's both powerful and maintainable.
