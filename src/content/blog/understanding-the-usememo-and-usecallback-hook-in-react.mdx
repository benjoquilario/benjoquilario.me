## What are React Hooks?

Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

Hooks make your work a lot easier and help you avoid repetitive code.

We're not going to discuss all React hooks, but we're going to understand what `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks are and when to use them.

### The useMemo Hook

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a value that is `expensive to compute`. This means that the value is only computed when one of its `dependencies changes`. This can be useful for `optimizing the performance` of a component that needs to `perform heavy computations` each time it renders.

We really need to understand the `useMemo` hook and how it works and when to use it, because if you don't use it when you should, it can trigger performance problems and might cause bugs or unexpected behavior.

First, let's talk about the problem of not using `useMemo`.

Take a look at this code and analyze it.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

const initialItems = new Array(29_999_999)
  .fill(0)
  .map((_, index) => ({ id: index, isSelected: index === 29_999_998 }))

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [items] = useState(initialItems)

  const selectedItem = items.find((item) => item.isSelected)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Selected Item: {selectedItem?.id}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you can see in the code above, we import `useState` from React and create `initialItems` with an array of 29,999,999 elements filled with 0, then we map over it and return an object with `id` and `isSelected` properties. The `isSelected` property is a boolean value that will only be `true` when the index equals 29,999,998 (the last item).

It looks normal - nothing seems wrong. We declare `useState`, pass `initialItems` as the initial state, and have `count` and `setCount` with an initial value of 0. But if you run this code in a React application, it will cause problems. Try it in your application and try to "spam" the increment button - you'll notice the `Count` is skipping numbers.

This is wrong and not how a `performant application` should behave. So what's the problem?

We need to look at our component and understand how React works under the hood, how React treats state updates, and how it renders components.

In our component, we have `count`, `items`, and `selectedItem`. When we click the button, all we're doing is calling the function in `onClick` and incrementing the count.

We need to understand that updating state means you have to trigger a re-render of the entire component.

The problem is that `selectedItem` is triggering our performance issues. If you look at what it does: it takes the `items` array and goes through the entire array to `find` the item where `isSelected` is true. But if we look at `initialItems`, the only item that has `isSelected` set to `true` is the last one, so it has to go through 29 million items before finding the selected item and returning that value. This is a very expensive operation.

Because we are changing the `count`, we are triggering the component to re-render and causing our `selectedItem` to be recalculated every time the count changes. This causes a huge performance issue - we're doing unnecessary computations on every render.

This is where `useMemo` comes into play.

Do we really need to use `useMemo` on `items`? If the `items` array stays the same, then no, because it remains the same no matter what happens. But if we look at our component, `selectedItem` is being recalculated unnecessarily.

```jsx
import { useState, useMemo } from "react"

const initialItems = new Array(29_999_999)
  .fill(0)
  .map((_, index) => ({ id: index, isSelected: index === 29_999_998 }))

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [items] = useState(initialItems)

  const selectedItem = useMemo(
    () => items.find((item) => item.isSelected),
    [items]
  )

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Selected Item: {selectedItem?.id}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, `selectedItem` will only be recalculated if the `items` dependency in the `useMemo` dependency array changes.

Go back to your application and try to spam the increment button. You'll see the difference between the two approaches - when we're not using the `useMemo` hook, there's lag and skipping numbers. With `useMemo`, there's no lag, no skipping numbers, and it's super efficient.

### The useCallback Hook

The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize a function. This means that the function is only recreated when one of its dependencies changes. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of a component that passes functions as props to child components.

Let's first understand the problem of not using `useCallback`.

#### The Problem: Function Recreation on Every Render

Take a look at this code and analyze it:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

const ExpensiveChildComponent = ({ onClick, items }) => {
  console.log("ExpensiveChildComponent rendered")

  // Simulate expensive computation
  const processedItems = items.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    processed: true,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  }))

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Processed Items: {processedItems.length}</h3>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [items] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: "Item 1" },
    { id: 2, name: "Item 2" },
    { id: 3, name: "Item 3" },
  ])

  // This function is recreated on every render
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!")
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <ExpensiveChildComponent onClick={handleClick} items={items} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, every time the `count` state changes and the `ParentComponent` re-renders, a new `handleClick` function is created. Even though the function does exactly the same thing, React sees it as a different function because it's a new reference.

This causes the `ExpensiveChildComponent` to re-render unnecessarily because it receives a "new" `onClick` prop every time, even though the function's behavior hasn't changed.

You'll notice in the console that "ExpensiveChildComponent rendered" is logged every time you click the increment button, even though the `items` prop hasn't changed and the `onClick` function does the same thing.

#### The Solution: Using useCallback

```jsx
import { useState, useCallback } from "react"

const ExpensiveChildComponent = ({ onClick, items }) => {
  console.log("ExpensiveChildComponent rendered")

  // Simulate expensive computation
  const processedItems = items.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    processed: true,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  }))

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Processed Items: {processedItems.length}</h3>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [items] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: "Item 1" },
    { id: 2, name: "Item 2" },
    { id: 3, name: "Item 3" },
  ])

  // This function is memoized and only recreated if dependencies change
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Button clicked!")
  }, []) // Empty dependency array means this function never changes

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <ExpensiveChildComponent onClick={handleClick} items={items} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, `handleClick` is memoized using `useCallback`. Since the dependency array is empty `[]`, the function reference never changes. This means `ExpensiveChildComponent` won't re-render when the `count` changes, because its props (`onClick` and `items`) remain the same.

#### When useCallback Dependencies Matter

Here's an example where the callback depends on state:

```jsx
import { useState, useCallback } from "react"

const TodoList = ({ todos, onToggle }) => {
  console.log("TodoList rendered")

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={todo.completed}
            onChange={() => onToggle(todo.id)}
          />
          {todo.text}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

const TodoApp = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    { id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: "Master useCallback", completed: false },
  ])
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState("all")

  // This callback depends on the current todos state
  const handleToggle = useCallback((id) => {
    setTodos((currentTodos) =>
      currentTodos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    )
  }, []) // We can use empty deps because we use the functional update form

  const filteredTodos = todos.filter((todo) => {
    if (filter === "completed") return todo.completed
    if (filter === "active") return !todo.completed
    return true
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setFilter("all")}>All</button>
        <button onClick={() => setFilter("active")}>Active</button>
        <button onClick={() => setFilter("completed")}>Completed</button>
      </div>
      <TodoList todos={filteredTodos} onToggle={handleToggle} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, even when the `filter` changes and causes a re-render, the `TodoList` component won't re-render unnecessarily because the `handleToggle` function reference remains stable.

#### Key Points About useCallback:

1. **Use it when passing functions as props** to child components that are expensive to render
2. **The dependency array matters** - include any values from component scope that the function uses
3. **Don't overuse it** - it has its own overhead, so only use it when you have a performance problem
4. **Combine with React.memo** on child components for maximum effectiveness

```jsx
import React from "react"

const ExpensiveChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick, items }) => {
  console.log("ExpensiveChildComponent rendered")

  // Expensive computation here...

  return <div>{/* Component JSX */}</div>
})
```

By wrapping the child component with `React.memo`, it will only re-render when its props actually change, making the `useCallback` optimization effective.

## Conclusion

Understanding `useMemo` and `useCallback` is crucial for building performant React applications. Here are the key takeaways:

### When to use useMemo:

- ✅ For expensive calculations that depend on specific values
- ✅ When creating objects or arrays that are passed as props
- ✅ When the computation is truly expensive (like processing large datasets)
- ❌ Don't use it for simple calculations or primitive values
- ❌ Don't use it everywhere - it has its own overhead

### When to use useCallback:

- ✅ When passing functions as props to child components
- ✅ When the child component is wrapped with `React.memo`
- ✅ When functions are dependencies of other hooks
- ❌ Don't use it for functions that don't get passed as props
- ❌ Don't use it if the dependencies change frequently

### Best Practices:

1. **Profile first** - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance bottlenecks
2. **Measure the impact** - Don't optimize prematurely
3. **Combine optimizations** - Use `React.memo` with `useCallback` for maximum effectiveness
4. **Keep dependency arrays accurate** - Include all values from component scope that are used

Remember, these hooks are optimization tools. Use them when you have identified actual performance problems, not as a default solution for every function or calculation in your components.
