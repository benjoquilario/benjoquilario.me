Probably the most important project, I've worked on, my personal portfolio and blog, is a platform where I share my journey as a web developer. It serves as a showcase for my projects, experiences, and insights in the field of web development.

Building this personal portfolio is a great learning experience, as it allows me to apply various web development technologies and best practices.

I probably don't need to show the images because you are already looking at it.

Showcased 100% Vercel Speed Insights on Desktop and 90% on Mobile.
