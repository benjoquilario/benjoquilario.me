Our thesis project at AMA University involved developing a web-based management system to streamline operations and improve efficiency for the House of Refuge Foundation Inc.

Previously, the organization managed their operations using piles of paperwork. To address this, we created a system that enables them to manage their operations more efficiently and access information quickly and easily.

Their goal was to have everything online and just a search away. Our solution provides a centralized platform to help them manage their operations effectively.
