> **Note**: This project is not yet fully completed, and still under development.

This project is my mother's online furniture store, JMQ Furniture Store, is a modern e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers looking for high-quality furniture. The store features a wide range of products, including sofas, chairs, tables, and more, all presented in a user-friendly interface.

My mother wanted to expand her business online, and I took on the challenge of building a fully functional e-commerce website that showcases her products and allows customers to make purchases easily.

My mother used to manage customer inquiries through Facebook Messenger and mentioned that she wanted a website where customers could browse products, as she was tired of repeatedly sending images and waiting for responses. She wanted a platform where customers could easily view products, make purchases, and enjoy a more streamlined shopping experience.
