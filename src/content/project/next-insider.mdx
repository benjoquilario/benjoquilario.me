The first version repo way back in 2022: [https://github.com/benjoquilario/insider](https://github.com/benjoquilario/insider) ⛔️ DEPRECATED

This application is memorable for me because it was my first fullstack application that I built. I created the first version of this application way back in 2022 while I was still learning and experimenting with different technologies. Initially, it was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), but I later decided to rebuild it using Next.js and TypeScript to take advantage of their powerful features and improve the overall developer experience.

### History

Back in 2022, I was thrilled to have built my first fullstack application and eagerly shared it with my friends. They, in turn, shared it with others, but things quickly went wrong. The application was hit by DDoS attacks and spam, causing it to crash. People posted inappropriate content and offensive language, and I didn’t know how to handle the situation. After just three days, I decided to shut down the application.

That experience taught me a lot, especially about the importance of security, rate limiting, and scalability in web applications. I realized I needed to implement stronger security measures and optimize the application to handle higher traffic.

### Lessons learned

- **Security**: I learned the hard way about the importance of securing user input and preventing malicious attacks. This experience taught me to implement proper validation, sanitization, rate limiting, and security measures in my applications.
- **Scalability**: I realized that building a scalable application requires careful planning and architecture. I needed to consider how to handle increased traffic and user interactions without compromising performance.
